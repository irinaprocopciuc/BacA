            BacA (Backpacker Web Assistant) is an application that allows hikers to choose a route to explore a 
            foreign country while also offering the opportunity to find out nearest shops, hospitals, hotels.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h3 id="Introduction" class="text-info">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            With BacA, the users can see different touristic points of interest like coffee shops, restaurants, museums,
            shops, hospitals, and so much more, close to the hiking routes that the users will choose to go on.
            If they want, they can make a budget for the trip for an easier way to find the perfect place to visit.
            For example, if they are backpackers, they can find the cheapest restaurants or places to eat, but if they
            are simple travelers, that want to know better the culture of the country or region that they are visiting, 
            they will be able to find the best points of interest to fulfill their wishes, like museums or traditional restaurants. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The users will have the possibility 
            to add the points of interest to their route, making them visible on the map. At the same time, they will get 
            information about how they will have the possibility to contact the authorities if they need help by showing 
            them the emergency number, based on the geographic zone that they will travel through.  
            The user will also have the possibility to save the routes for later use or future use for a newly planned trip.

        <h3 id="Technologies" class="text-info"> Technologies </h3>
        <p>In this chapter we are going to give some details about the technologie we will use on the frontend and
            backend side,
            but also about the public API's we found useful for our application.</p>
        <br>
        <h4 id="front-end" class="text-info">Front End Technologies</h4>
        <p>
            In order to develop the user interface we chose to use <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular
                framework</a>
            because it will help us build
            maintainable and easy to use components. Also, we will integrate Angular Material, a library which contains
            pre-build styled components, in order to have UI consistency between pages.
        </p>
        <p>For the installation of the packages and also to run and test the app we will use the <span
                class="text-danger">npm</span> package manager
            from Node.js.</p>
        <p>
            Apart from that we used a series of additional packages that helped us in the development of various key
            functionalities:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="text-secondary"><code>Angular Material</code></span>
                <p class="ml-4">This is a an official component library build by Angular and Typescript. It
                    contains pre-build components which can be styled using pre-defined properties. This library also
                    follows the best UI practicies like adding new features promptly from command line templates. Some
                    of the available components we will use from here are: navigation bar, button, input, card, menu.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="text-secondary"><code>Angular Google Maps</code></span>
                <p class="ml-4">The Angular Google Maps library provides services and directives for implementing Google
                    Maps services. There are directives available for creating maps, using markers and many others. It
                    also provides an async function that is useful for checking if the Google Maps library is loaded on
                    the webpage.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="text-secondary"><code>ngx-charts</code></span>
                <p class="ml-4">This library is used for data visualization and can handle various forms of
                    customizations while rendering. In ngx-charts their charts rely mostly on using Angular to animate
                    SVGs, which offers more speed and flexibility as this library was optimized for use in Angular.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <h4 id="back-end" class="text-info">Back End Technologies</h4>
        <p>For the backend part we plan to develop a REST API that would provide data in json format to the client.
            In order to achieve this we will use Java as the main programming language. On top of this it comes the
            <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot" target="_blank">Spring Boot framework</a>, a very popular
            Java-based
            framework for building web applications.
        </p>
        <p>For the data persistence layer we will use <a href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a>, an
            open-source
            relational
            database management system.</p>
        <p>Other dependencies used are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>Maven</code>
                <p class="ml-4">The most popular build and dependency management for Java, <a
                        href="https://maven.apache.org/" target="_blank">Maven</a>
                    will help us manage all the dependencies of our project. It will help us easily add jars and other
                    dependencies to the project, and update them rapidly when needed.</p>
            </li>
            <li><code>Jackson</code>
                <p class="ml-4">Jackson is a very populare and efficient java based library, used to serialize or map
                    java objects to JSON and vice versa. It provides a high level facade to simplify commonly used use
                    cases and also provides default mapping for most of the objects to be serialized.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <h4 id="apis" class="text-info">APIs</h4>
        <p>In this subchaper we will describe which APIs we decided to include in our application and what are their use for it.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code> <a href="https://api.fsapp.io/docs" target="_blank">Fantastic Stay API</a></code>
                <p>
                    This API will give us informations about where the user stayed during his trip, if the reservation
                    was done properly and also
                    will allow the user to write reviews for a specific accomodation and to see how much he spent there.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>
                    <a href="https://developer.trimblemaps.com/" target="_blank">Trimble Trip API</a>
                </code>
                <p>
                    Another API we found useful was the Trimble Trip API which provides us with the tools to build
                    routing, scheduling and navigation
                    features in our applications. With its help we will be able to calculate the trip costs, to search
                    for the user's location and to
                    update it accuretly on the map. Also, it offers and a trip management solution for the users who
                    like to travel by car.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>
                    <a href="https://allmyles.docs.apiary.io/#reference/dashboard-api" target="_blank">Allmyles API</a>
                </code>
                <p>
                    This API will give us informations about the bookings for a specific user, flights he planed, hotels
                    where he reserved any rooms and
                    will also provide us the nearest airport or the location of the hotel.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>
                    <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview" target="_blank">Maps Javascript API</a>
                </code>
                <p>
                    This API will provide us with a way to customize maps with our own content and imagery, allowing us
                    to display the maps on web pages and mobile devices. The Maps Javascript API features four basic map
                    types(roadmap, satellite, hybrid and terrain) which can be modified using layers and styles,
                    controls and events, and various services and libraries.
                </p>
            </li>

        <h3 id="Structure" class="text-info">Architecture</h3>
        <img src="assets/architecture_diagram.png" class="img-fluid mt-4 mb-4" alt="UseCaseLogin">
        <p>
            As we can see, the architecture of the application is implemented based on the following elements :
             Client (Web browser and mobile browser), Angular frontend application, Appi, Java with Spring Boot backend and MySQL database.
        </p>
     
        <p>
           The communication between this services is shown below:

            <h5>Client</h5>
            <p>
                The application can be accessed through web browser or mobile browser. The user can get in contact 
                with the frontend part that we will be doing in Angular frontend application.

                   Through Angular frontend application some of the public API will be accesed: Fantastic stay API, 
                   Maps Javascript API, Trimble Trip API and Allmyles API. With the help of API we can find details 
                   like where is a person accomodated, located, the shops and hospitals around or a police station 
                   that he or she can go to. 
                   Also, the frontend application will communicate with the backend through some API made by us.

        <hr>
        <p>In this chapter, we are going to give some details about the pages that the user will interact with.</p>
        <h4 id="front-end" class="text-info">Login page</h4>
        <p>
            On the login page, the user can be authenticated into the application. The user has two more options: 
            the case in which he is not registered, he can register, and if he forgets his authentication details, 
            in this case, the password, he can request his password to be reset.  
            The two fields required for the login are the username and the password.
            <img src="assets/user_login.png" class="img-fluid mt-4 mb-4" alt="LoginPage">
        </p>
        <h4 id="front-end" class="text-info">Register page</h4>
        <p>On the register page, new users can create new accounts. 
            The fields required for this process will be the username, password, email, and name. </p>
            <img src="assets/Register.png" class="img-fluid mt-4 mb-4" alt="RegisterPage">
        <h4 id="front-end" class="text-info">Home page</h4>
            On the home page, the user can see his current selected route, used for traveling at that moment. 
        Also, the application will show him a history of routes used in the past or routes made by him for future hikes. 
        The routes can be sorted, at least, by name, creation date, country. 
        He can reuse them in the future if he comes again to a visited place or country.
            <img src="assets/Routes.png" class="img-fluid mt-4 mb-4" alt="RoutesPage">
        <h4 id="front-end" class="text-info">Trip details page</h4>
        <p>
            On the trip details page, the user can see details about the trip he will go into, like the starting point, 
            the destination, and the points of interest suggested by the application. He can show them on the map or pin 
            them permanently for going there during the travel through his route. On the other side of the page, a map will 
            show the user the route with all the modifications. Also, he will see the emergency number of the country or 
            region where he will trip.

                <p class="ml-4">The login into our application can be described by the following steps:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                    <li>When first entering the application, the user will encounter the homepage with two buttons
                        available in the menu:
                        Login(used in case the user already has an account created) and Register(if the user still
                        doesn't have any credentials).</li>
                    <li>If he already has an account he will fill the username and the password which will be validated
                        using the validateUser method and after pressing the Login button,
                        if everything it's ok,he will be redirected to homepage and a success message will be displayed.
                        Otherwise, an error will pop up and the user will need to introduce the credentials again.
                        hopefully the right ones this time.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the user doesn't have an account he will press the Register button and will fill the form

                        with a password by his choice. After successfully registered, the user will be redirected to
                        Login page and he will follow the step described above
                        in order to access the application.
                    </li>
                    <li>In everything goes smoothly, now the user should be able to navigate to the other pages of our
                        application.</li>
                    <li>If the user doesn't want to login to our app, he still can access the homepage where there will
                        be some generic informations, but
                        he won't be able to log his trips and see other details about them.
